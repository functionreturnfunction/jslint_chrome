* TODO Create a real icon!!!
* TODO Figure out why some errors are null
* TODO Either filter script urls that don't start with /^https?/, or prepend if possible
  This is working for the most part, but there are still some issues.  For
  example, the top two scripts on the github page for this project will not
  load.  Whereas most of these kinds of scripts start with a forward slash,
  those start with two which may indicate the domain?  Also relative urls with
  path modifiers ('..') are not accounted for, nor are paths that don't start
  with any forward slashes.
* TODO Decide upon the best format for error output in the popup
* TODO Determine if the closures are necessary
* TODO Implement some level of functional or integration testing
* TODO General UI niceness, fix layout, css, etc.
* TODO Determine best way to build the extension and minify/pack the js files (retaining header/copyright info)
