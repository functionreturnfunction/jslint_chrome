* TODO Create a real icon!!!
* TODO Figure out why some errors are null
* TODO Either filter script urls that don't start with /^https?/, or prepend if possible
  Not sure why those show up either, are they parts of extensions, or scripts
  that aren't fully qualified?
* TODO Decide upon the best format for error output in the popup
* TODO Determine if the closures are necessary
* TODO Implement some level of functional or integration testing
* TODO General UI niceness, fix layout, css, etc.
* TODO Determine best way to build the extension and minify/pack the js files (retaining header/copyright info)
