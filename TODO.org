* TODO Create a real icon!!!
* TODO Figure out why some errors are null
* TODO Either filter script urls that don't start with /^https?/, or prepend if possible
  Not sure why those show up either, are they parts of extensions, or scripts
  that aren't fully qualified?
* TODO Decide upon the best format for error output in the popup
* TODO Rename dom.js to something more appropriate
* TODO Implement some level of functional or integration testing
* TODO General UI niceness, fix layout, css, etc.
